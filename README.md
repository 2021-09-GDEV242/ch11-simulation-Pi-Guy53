# Ch10-Simulator
I added snakes, a predator that will eat both foxes and rabbits
They do not live quite as long as foxes, and breed less, but they are
less prone to starving. 
The snakes can sometimes eat all the foxes, and the foxes sometimes
starve out the snakes, but for the most part they stay balanced.
The snakes do have a 15% probablity to eat a fox, so this helps to mitigate
the snakes eating all of the foxes.
